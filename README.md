# For Vencord users
Sadly, Vencord users can't configure DarkVibez as Vencord gets the theme directly from GitHub. If you want to configure DarkVibez, think about switching to BetterDiscord. Alternatively, you can paste DarkVibez into QuickCSS.

# About Discord Web-App
DarkVibez v2 does not support the Web-App. If you want to use DarkVibez v2, consider getting the Desktop-App and use it with BetterDiscord or Vencord.
DarkVibez v1 works with the Web-App. Get it here: https://github.com/ProjectShadowSRC/DarkVibez

# About Light mode
DarkVibez v2 is not meant to be used with Light mode! Doing so WILL cause visual problems.

# About Discord Nitro themes
DarkVibez v2 blocks the selection of these Nitro themes. If you have one enabled, switch back to default Dark mode.
